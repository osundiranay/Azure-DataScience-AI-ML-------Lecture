# Python-code-for-Azure-ML

Python code for implementing various AI projects using Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services.
A Microsoft Azure subscription is required since you will need a authorization key and an endpoint to deploy a model using these code.

## Services:

### I. Azure Machine Learning:
1. Deploy a predictive service.

### II. Custom Vision:
1. Face detection.
2. Image classification.
3. Object detection.
4. Optical character recognition.
5. Form recognition.

### III. NLP (Speech, Text, LUIS):
1. Language understanding.
2. Speech recognition and speech synthesis.
3. Text analysis.
4. Language translation


**Important**: This repository is a collection of Python code from the learning paths' notebooks to prepare for the Microsoft AI-900 exam (_not my personal work_). Although I passed the exam, I still want to save these code here so that I can refer quickly to them when I do AI projects on Azure.

For detailed information on how to implement the code, check out this reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/azure-sdk-overview

# Python Code for Data Science, AI, ML on Microsoft Azure 

Python code for implementing various AI, ML projects on Microsoft Azure could platform.
A Microsoft Azure subscription is required since you will need a authorization key and an endpoint to deploy a model using these code.

### I. Azure Machine Learning:
1. Deploy a predictive service.

### II. Custom Vision:
1. Face detection.
2. Image classification.
3. Object detection.
4. Optical character recognition.
5. Form recognition.

### III. NLP (Speech, Text, LUIS):
1. Language understanding.
2. Speech recognition and speech synthesis.
3. Text analysis.
4. Language translation

### IV. General Data Science:
1. Python code/snipets for data science.


**Important**: This repository is a collection of Python code from various Microsoft Learn's learning paths (_not my personal work_). I want to save these code here so that I can refer quickly to them when I do Data, AI, ML projects on Azure.
